# CATCH APP (LOVERS EDITION) Chatting Application.

## A simple application written in Java, where you can exchange messages with others.

A JAVA project written in Eclipse Workspace and connected to SQLite Database has created the Catch App application, where users create their own profile and are able to communicate through exchanging messages with others.
Every part of the code shows how to do the following:

*	Create graphics with Java Swing and Java Awt packages.
*	Implement actionPerformed method from ActionListener interface with which the buttons are activated. 
*	Create an DbConnection object, which succeeds in making a connection with our database in SQLite. 
*	Create the SQLite queries in order to fill the tables with the user’s data and edit/get the data in order to complete the basic – for the application – procedures such as login, register, send message, show messages and show the user’s profile.
